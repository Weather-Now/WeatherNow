# Agile Reflections


### 1. 

It's easy to overlook small details in the rush to complete a project. However, by implementing daily stand-ups and stand-downs, we ensured that nothing was missed. This practice allowed us to catch mistakes early, avoid duplicating efforts, and preemptively address potential roadblocks through diligent communication.

### 2. 

The prospect of building a project from scratch in a week can be daunting. This often leads to stress and procrastination. By utilizing a scrum board and working closely with a partner, we broke the project into manageable tasks. Starting with simple milestones, like setting up the GitHub repository, provided momentum and helped us complete the project ahead of schedule.

### 3. 

We created a timeline by estimating the duration of each task, which helped us prioritize and sequence our work efficiently. This strategy allowed us to focus on getting a basic, functional version up and running quickly, paving the way for smoother implementation of subsequent components.

### 4. 

For this project, we chose to work collaboratively on most tasks. While this approach may differ from typical workplace delegation, it offered valuable lessons in trust, support, and accountability. Experimenting with dividing components among ourselves showed the strengths of working closely together and reinforced the importance of trust within a team.

## Agile Overview

This project not only led to a successful outcome but also provided us with invaluable lessons on communication, task management, timeline planning, and collaboration. These insights will undoubtedly influence our approach to future projects.
