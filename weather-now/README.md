# WeatherNow!

## Created by Rafi and Angelica

### Mission Statement
Our application, **WeatherNow!**, is designed for weather enthusiasts. It provides users with local information on weather, time, moon phase, sunrise, and sunset based on user input.

### API
This application utilizes the Weather API for fetching weather-related data. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use:

- **Weather API Documentation**: [WeatherAPI.com](https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com)

**Endpoints**:
1. **Current Weather Information**: `https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com/current.json`
2. **Local Time Information**: `https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com/timezone.json`
3. **Sunrise, Sunset, and Moonphase**: `https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com/astronomy.json`

**API Key Requirement**: This project requires an API key

### MVP User Stories
The core features of the application include:
- Viewing local weather information based on user input.
- Accessing sunrise and sunset information for the user-specified location.
- Viewing the local time based on the user-submitted location.
- Viewing the current moon phase with relevant information.

### Stretch User Stories
If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:
- Access to a dark/light mode, adjusting the page theme to user preference.
- Retrieval of longitude and latitude based on location.

### Timeline for reaching MVP in 1 week
To complete all core features of the application within a week, we will follow this timeline:

**Day 1**:
- Create GitHub organization and repo for the project.
- Set up Vite project and create directory tree.
- Create scrum board and plan workflow.
- Make a high-level list of functions needed.
- Create input form and basic JSX.

**Day 2**:
- Create and import helper functions; initialize variables.
- Develop functions for fetching and rendering data.

**Day 3 (MVP)**:
- Implement API calls and display data based on user input.
- Implement functionality and navigation between pages.

**Day 4**:
- Design and develop the visual story for the app.
- Implement front-end design.

**Day 5**:
- Review and finalize front-end design.
