# WeatherNow!

## Project Overview

This project is a weather forecasting application built using **Vite** for the front-end, **Express** for the back-end server, and **WeatherAPI.com** for retrieving real-time weather and astronomical data. The app allows users to search for a city and displays the current weather, local time, sunrise/sunset times, and moon phase information.

## Features

- **Local Time**: Display local time based on the user's location or city input.
- **Sunrise, Sunset, and Moon Phase**: Provide daily information about sunrise, sunset, and moon phases.
- **Back-End Server**: Used **Express** to serve API data and handle requests to WeatherAPI.com.
- Real-time data fetched using the **WeatherAPI.com** REST API via RapidAPI.

## Tools Used
- **Vite**: Fast front-end development environment with hot module reloading and optimized builds.
- **Express**: Back-end server to handle API requests and serve data to the front end.
- **WeatherAPI.com**: Used for fetching real-time weather, time, and astronomical data.
- **JavaScript (with JSX)**: For scripting and handling API requests.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the application.
